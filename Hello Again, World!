  <h1>Hello Again, World!</h1>
  <h2>What Interests me?</h2>
  <p>One thing that I seem to have some kind of interest in is poetry. While not necessarily seen as something too normal, it is something that can catch the attention of some people if done right. It interests me how you can express such emotion in such a short and vague way. I never seriously tried writing poetry, but I plan to start doing so at some point before I become an adult and have too many responsibilities. If you are interested in poetry as well, here is a link to a website where people share their poems.</p>
