  <h1>Hello World</h1>
<h2>My favourite passtime</h2> 
<p>My life is quite uneventful so my favourite passtime is playing video games. My favourite is likely Super Smash Bros. Ultimate because it is one of the games that I can see myself playing for a very, very long time. I used to play it a lot with my friends, though it seems like they all quit the game at this point.</p>

  <h3>My Least Favourite Subject</h3>
  <p1>My least favourite subject is probably Geography. This is because I do not see it helping me in the future, and I have next to no interest in the subject. Much of whether you like a subject or not is based on the teacher and how they teach you the material, and my ninth grade geography class was very stressful due to the way that the teacher taught us.</p1>
